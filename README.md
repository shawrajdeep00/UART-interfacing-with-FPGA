# UART Transmission System Using FPGA

## Project Overview

This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) communication system using FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) technology. UART is widely used for asynchronous serial communication where only two wires are needed for data transmission and reception. The project incorporates both the transmitter and receiver modules, button debouncing logic, and a full simulation environment with waveforms, schematics, and synthesized designs. It is designed, synthesized, and tested using Xilinx Vivado tools, targeting a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA platform.

This repository demonstrates a complete end-to-end system, highlighting expertise in FPGA programming, hardware description languages (VHDL), and digital design practices. 

## Features

- **Button debouncing mechanism**: Integrated debounce logic to ensure reliable button press detection.
- **Testbench with simulation**: A comprehensive testbench to simulate and verify UART functionality using Xilinx Vivado’s simulator.
- **FPGA Synthesis and Implementation**: Realized using Xilinx Vivado tools, with detailed schematics and synthesized designs.

- **Clear documentation of design flow**: Showcases RTL schematics, synthesized designs, and implementation details.

## Project Components

### 1. UART Transmitter
The UART transmitter takes 8-bit parallel input data, converts it into a serial format, and transmits it over a single wire according to UART protocol (start/stop bits and no parity in this implementation).

- **File**: [`UART_transmitter_vhd.vhd`](path-to-file)
- **Features**:
  - Supports standard UART frame format with 8 data bits.
  - Generates start, data, and stop bits sequentially.
  - Handles the serialization of data.
  - Built-in state machine that transitions through IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP states.

### 2. UART Receiver
The UART receiver module reconstructs the 8-bit parallel data from the incoming serial data stream. It identifies start and stop bits and ensures proper framing of data.

- **File**: [`UART_receiver_vhd.vhd`](path-to-file)
- **Features**:
  - Detects start and stop bits.
  - Reads incoming serial data and converts it back to an 8-bit parallel format.
  - State machine implementation for IDLE, START, DATA, and STOP phases.

### 3. Push Button Debouncer
Mechanical buttons often generate multiple transitions when pressed due to bouncing, causing unreliable inputs. This debouncing circuit ensures a clean and stable signal for button presses.

- **File**: [`pushbutton_debounce_vhd.vhd`](path-to-file)
- **Functionality**:
  - Stabilizes noisy signals from mechanical button presses.
  - Provides clean output after filtering unwanted transitions.

### 4. UART Controller (Top-Level Design)
The UART controller integrates the transmitter, receiver, and button debounce modules, managing the control flow and coordinating data transmission and reception.

- **File**: [`UART_Controller_vhd.vhd`](path-to-file)
- **Functionality**:
  - Manages data flow between the transmitter and receiver.
  - Controls the state transitions and timing between different modules.
  - Serves as the top-level module for synthesis and testing.

### 5. Testbench for Simulation
A custom testbench simulates the entire system to verify functionality. The testbench generates the clock, reset, and data signals and checks the output against expected values.

- **File**: [`UART_Controller_testbench_vhd.vhd`](path-to-file)
- **Waveform Configuration**: [`UART_Controller_testbench_behavior.wcfg`](path-to-file)
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates test vectors to verify UART transmission and reception.
  - Monitors system response and checks for proper timing and data accuracy.
  - Includes different test scenarios: varying data inputs, reset conditions, and clock cycles.
  - Produces waveform output for detailed analysis of UART operations.

### 6. Constraints (XDC File)
The constraints file maps the design's I/O ports to the physical pins of the FPGA, ensuring that UART transmission, reception, and button control signals are correctly routed to the board.

- **File**: [`constraints_xdc.tcl`](path-to-file)
- **Details**:
  - Defines FPGA pin mappings for UART TX, RX, and button inputs.
  - Includes clock configuration and timing constraints for proper FPGA operation.

## Simulation and Testing

The UART system was rigorously tested using Vivado’s built-in simulation environment. Key test cases included:

- **Serial Data Transmission**: Sending `0x55` (binary `01010101`) from the transmitter to the receiver and verifying the correctness of the received data.
- **Start/Stop Bit Detection**: Ensuring that the UART system correctly identifies the start and stop bits and reads data only during the DATA phase.
- **Idle State Handling**: Verifying that the transmitter and receiver both enter the IDLE state when no data is being transmitted.
- **Debounced Button Input**: Checking that button presses are correctly debounced and do not generate multiple signals.

### Waveform Analysis
The simulation shows proper timing and functionality of the UART protocol. The transitions between the start, data, and stop bits can be observed and validated in the waveform output, ensuring that the system operates within expected parameters.
